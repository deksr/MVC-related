Things learned:

1) Created a simple.js. If app.js or server.js is not found then npm start doesn't start. 
Therefore In package.json add  start to scripts
 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node simple.js"
  },

  Or even simpler way of doing is just run `node simple.js`

2) Using es6 export modules:

3) Installing babel as a transpiler for es6 modules(read below). or even better option is to: "There are a few popular bundlers, most of which use Babel as a dependency to transpile your ES6 modules to CommmonJS.""









modules are part of es6. browsers don't have transpilers where it takes ECMAScript 6 source code and outputs valid ES5 that will run in all modern, and even some not-so-modern, JavaScript browser environments.

 `npm install -g babel-cli`
 `npm install babel-cli --save`
